# Induction-Motor-Simulation
The project performs the simulation of a 3-phase 4 pole induction motor under free acceleration, i.e no load torque. Correspondingly, the following parameters are studied:
1. Rotor Current (Transient and Steady State)
2. Electromagnetic Torque as a function of rotor speed
3. Instantaneous Power for the rotor, stator, and the shaft

An in-depth description of the performed experiments can be found in Problem_Statement.pdf
